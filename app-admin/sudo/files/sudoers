## when running commands via sudo.
##
## Locale settings
# Defaults env_keep += "LANG LANGUAGE LINGUAS LC_* _XKB_CHARSET"

## Run X applications through sudo; HOME is used to find the
## .Xauthority file.  Note that other programs use HOME to find

# Defaults env_keep += "XAPPLRESDIR XFILESEARCHPATH XUSERFILESEARCHPATH"
##
## Desktop path settings
# Defaults env_keep += "QTDIR KDEDIR"

##
## Uncomment to use a hard-coded PATH instead of the user's to find commands

##
## Uncomment to send mail if the user does not enter the correct password.
