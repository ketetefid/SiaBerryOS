##################### Global Variables for StorijOS #####################
# The preferred way of working with this file is
# through Storij-WebUI. It is better to work from the UI and not by
# directly editing this file. 

# Sia directory path. Try to specify it under /mnt/disk/ so that creating
# the Sia structure on external devices (like flash drives) will be possible.
SCDIR=/mnt/disk2/scsoft

# HyperSpace director path. Remember that different chains need different
# mount points in the parent like /mnt/disk1 & /mnt/disk2
XSCDIR=/mnt/disk1/xscsoft

# Run Sia daemon as this user. The user will automatically be created.
# Remember to only use lower case letters and do not use special characters. Also
# your preferred name must not have any spaces and it must not begin with a number.
SIAUSR=storijer

# The hostname of the system. By default it is set to storijos but if you intend
# to run multiple storij devices on the same network, you had better set differnet
# hostnames for each of them as the chain addresses work based on this value and
# some conflict might arise if every device has the same name.
hostname=storijos

# Internal IP that the Pi will get. Starting with Storij v1.0.0 if you change this
# parameter directly via editing this file, you will need to issue "rc-update add ipsetter"
# after each change, to make the OS get the IP. If you use Storij-WebUI, everything is
# automated and you do not need to do the extra step.
# Also, you may set this to "auto" which, then, will automatically get an IP in the pattern
# of xxx.xxx.xxx.100. Remember that you will need to reboot your Pi to make it get the new IP.
int_ip=auto

# The external static IP address, if your ISP has given one to you. If you do not own one, then
# use the "dynamic" external IP type below.
ext_ip=100.100.100.100

# Your domain name, in case you have acquired one. It will not have a direct effect until you
# create an SSL certificate for the WebUI through certbot. For more information, refer to the
# Howto/QuickStart guide.
domain_name=yournicedomainname.com

# Shall we use the domain_name provided above instead of the static IP  when announcing the host?
# 0 means no and 1 means yes.
use_domain=0

# Shall we expand the root partition to the maximum available space in the next boot?
# 0 means no and 1 means yes. Anything else means no as well. This should be done once.
expand=0

# Shall we format the attached drive on the next boot and create HyperSpace structure in it?
# 0 means no; 1 means bootstrapping and 2 means downloading a pre-compiled layout.
# Anything else means no as well.
setup_xsc=0

# Format the attached drive on the next boot and construct Sia on it. 
# 0 means no; 1 means bootstrapping and 2 means downloading a pre-compiled layout.
# Anything else means no as well.
setup_sc=0

# Specify the "host" port for the HyperSpace daemon.
xsc_host_port=6682

# Specify the "RPC" port for the HyperSpace daemon.
xsc_rpc_port=6681

# Specify the "host" port for the Sia daemon.
sc_host_port=5582

# Specify the "RPC" port for the Sia daemon.
sc_rpc_port=5581

# Would you like the system to auto unlock your wallet on every boot?
# 1 means yes and 0 means no. Anything else means no as well.
# If you are enabling this option directly via editing this file and not through
# the WebUI, You NEED to edit the file "/usr/local/bin/unlocker" and put your wallet password
# on the line before the last one. The WebUI automatically does this.
# This option works with "setup_xsc". If you decide to prepare a flash drive
# for running the HyperSpace software, you can set this parameter to 1 and it will enable
# the auto unlocking after it prepares the drive.
xsc_auto_unlock=0

# Do automatic unlocking for Sia chain
sc_auto_unlock=0

# The type of external IP you have. If it is static, then set it to "static" or "1".
# Anything else means dynamic, like "dynamic" or "0".
# If you are not using the WebUI, after each change to "static", run as root:
#    	 rc-service ddclient stop; rc-update del ddclient
# And if you are not using the WebUI, after each change to "dynamic", and when you have set
# the FreeDNS parameters below, run as root:
#     	 rc-service ddclient start; rc-update add ddclient
ext_ip_type=static

# In case your external IP is dynamic, set the username for login at http://freedns.afraid.org/
# here. You will need to set the password through the Web-UI or enter it directly in
# /etc/ddclient/ddclient.conf.
freedns_login=storij

# If your external IP is dynamic, set this parameter to your domain you have set on
# http://freedns.afraid.org/.
freedns_domain=storij.ddns.net

# msdos or gpt for the attached hard drives? GPT is of course better but some UEFI systems
# corrupt the GPT table of the attached hard disks. If you are on a Pi, you can safely
# choose gpt.
disklayout=msdos

# Specify the network device here. We will need it mainly for upnp.
# most of the time it is eth0 (like storijos on a Raspberry pi 3).
# Please note that wireless connection is still being implemented and is not ready.
net_dev=eth0
